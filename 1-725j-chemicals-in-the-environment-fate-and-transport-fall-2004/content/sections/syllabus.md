------

Topics covered will include:

*   Control Volumes, Mass Balance, and Advective/Dispersive Transport
*   Chemical Equilibria, Mass Action, Electroneutrality, and Mass Conservation
*   Chemical Kinetics and Partitioning
*   River Transport, Lakes and Wetlands and Estuaries
*   Sediment Transport, Bottom Sediments, Paleolimnology
*   Air-Water Exchange
*   Major Ion Chemistry of Natural Waters
*   Ecosystem Characteristics and Redox Chemistry
*   BOD/DO Modeling and Microbial Kinetics
*   Photochemistry and Hydrolysis
*   Groundwater and Aquifers, Darcy's Law, and Flow Nets
*   Superposition, Capture Curves
*   Transient Well Hydraulics and Transport and Retardation
*   Unsaturated Zone Flow, Biodegradation and Bioremediation
*   Atmospheric Structure and Adiabatic Lapse Rates
*   Global, Synoptic, Local Scale Circulation
*   Gaussian Plume Modeling and Deposition Processes
*   Tropospheric Chemistry and Acid Deposition
